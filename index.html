			<h2 style="text-align:center">ABOUT ME</h2>
			<p style="text-align:center">
				After receiving a Master of Science degree in Epidemiology from the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, I took a job as a biostatistician for the MACS/WIHS Combined Cohort Study - an HIV observational study with sites all around the U.S., and the data center is located at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, MD. This job has been great, and I have greatly improved my skills in longitudinal data analysis, as well as my coding proficiency in SAS, R, and Stata. I am now hoping to launch a career as a data scientist, where I hope I will get to utilize machine-learning methods more often. Check out my blog for an example of a deep learning project I recently completed!

				Outside of work, I enjoy playing/watching ice hockey and attending concerts. My favorite hockey team is the Buffalo Sabres and my favorite band is Phish.

				I hope you enjoy browsing through this website, and please feel free to contact me through my email or Linkedin, links below.
