			<h2 style="text-align:center">ABOUT ME</h2>
			<p style="text-align:center">
				After receiving a Master of Science degree in Epidemiology from the Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health, I took a job as a biostatistician in the data center of the MACS/WIHS Combined Cohort Study - a national HIV observational study - at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, MD. I continued in this position until the summer of 2021. The research was extremely rewarding, and I improved my skills immensely in longitudinal data analysis, as well as my coding proficiency in SAS, R, and Stata.
			</p>
			<p style="text-align:center">
				In the fall of 2021 I began as a PhD student in the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine's Health Sciences Integrated PhD (HSIP) program, Health and Biomedical Informatics track. At HSIP I hope to focus my research on the reduction of health disparities, and learn to apply machine-learning methods to projects in the healthcare sector.
			</p>
			<p style="text-align:center">
				Outside of work, I enjoy playing/watching ice hockey, training for marathons, reading, scuba diving, and attending concerts. I am a fan of the Buffalo Sabres and Buffalo Bills, and my favorite band is Phish. I recently picked up playing bass guitar (not very well), and hope to improve enough to jam in a band! I also enjoy working on personal data science projects of interest, where I can apply a new method or work in a subject area that I do not usually get to - check out my blog for an example of a deep learning project I completed!
