			<h2 style="text-align:center">ABOUT ME</h2>
			<p style="text-align:center">
				After receiving a Master of Science degree in Epidemiology from the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, I took a job as a biostatistician for the MACS/WIHS Combined Cohort Study - an HIV observational study with sites all around the U.S., and the data center is located at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, MD. This job has been very rewarding, and I have improved my skills immensely in longitudinal data analysis, as well as my coding proficiency in SAS, R, and Stata. I am now hoping to launch a career as a data scientist, where I am interested in gaining more experience with machine-learning methods. Check out my blog for an example of a deep learning project I recently completed!

				Outside of work, I enjoy playing/watching ice hockey and attending concerts. My favorite hockey team is the Buffalo Sabres and my favorite band is Phish.
